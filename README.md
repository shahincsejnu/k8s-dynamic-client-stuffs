- This repo contains two separate things:
    1. `dynamic-client-example`: 
        - this is the example of a dynamic client
        - the basic CRUD operations with dynamic-client is given here
        - also in the `README.md` in that folder given the overview of dynamic client things
    
    2. rest of the part of this repo: 
        - write a sample controller using dynamic client which will watch all the given k8s objects.
        - which objects will be watched by the controller will be given in a file
